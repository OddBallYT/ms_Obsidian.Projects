A condition is a temporary game state. The definition of a condition says how it affects its recipient, and various rules define how to end a condition. This glossary defines these conditions:
> [!column|clean]
>> [!blank] 1
>> * [[Blinded]]
>> * [[Charmed]]
>> * [[Deafened]]
>> * [[Exhaustion]]
>> * [[Frightened]]
>> * [[Grappled]]
>> * [[Incapacitated]]
>> * [[Invisible]]
>
>> [!blank] 2
>> * [[Paralyzed]]
>> * [[Petrified]]
>> * [[Poisoned]]
>> * [[Prone]]
>> * [[Restrained]]
>> * [[Stunned]]
>> * [[Unconscious]]

A condition doesn’t stack with itself; a recipient either has a condition or doesn’t. The Exhaustion condition is an exception to that rule. _See also_ “[[Conditions]]”.
