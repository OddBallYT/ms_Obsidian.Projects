Challenge Rating (CR) summarizes the threat a monster poses to a group of four player characters. Compare a monster’s CR to the characters’ level. If the CR is higher, the monster is likely a danger. If the CR is lower, the monster likely poses little threat. But circumstances and the number of player characters can significantly alter how threatening a monster is in actual play. The _Dungeon Master’s Guide_ provides guidance to the DM on using CR while planning potential combat encounters. _See also_ “[[Stat Block]]”.
