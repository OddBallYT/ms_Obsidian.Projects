The robbery began to go awry, when Tansy's father Dimble intervened, leaving her father and mother killed. Tansy escaped and went west, arriving in [[Saulker]]. Working odd jobs as a scribe's assistant, courier, and finally a barmaid, until she worked enough to buy the Copper Mug from its previous owner, a human male named Jace.
