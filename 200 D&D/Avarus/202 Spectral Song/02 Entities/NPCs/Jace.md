## Story
#### Backstory
Born in [[Saulker]], the son of a farmhand. When he was 13, he got a job at the [[Trawler's Trail]], sustaining the injury to his lip when he was 15. When he was 17, he travelled to [[Black Rock]] to study brewing and distilling with a famous brewer called [[Hekel Mekkensson]]. He had a natural skill for liquor and brews, returning home when he was 26, and began to brew and distill, selling the drinks from his parent's home.

Eventually he was successful enough that he bought a large plot, and had an inn/tavern built. He named it "the coppermug", after [[Hekel Mekkensson|Hekel's]] tendency to use copper drinking vessles for all his brews, convinced it 'enhanced the flavour'. Jace was never sure of this, but continued this as tradition in [[The Coppermug]], only using copper mugs to serve drinks.
