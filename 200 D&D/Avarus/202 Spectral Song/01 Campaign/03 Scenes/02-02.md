> Rows of cupboards line the back and side wall. About the dust covered black marble countertops are various cooking utensils, pots, pans, bottles and an assortment of food items. And an island in the centre of the room, with a rack hanging above holding lines of glasses, wooden spoons, and a single hammer. About the kitchen, you hear a clanging racket, coming from behind the island. You look over, as you see a small man rummaging through some cupboards, looking for something.

When the player/s get his attention, he turns around, read the following.
>[!recite|no-title]
> He jumps up, and turns to face you, wide eyed, and brandishing a butter knife. He's an older man, and an unusually small man, maybe 4 foot 6 or 8. Strange pointed ears and an upturned nose, with raised cheekbones and olive, wrinkled and thin looking skin. He almost has the features of a gnome, but he's much too big to be one, and the features are too faint. As his eyes, one twitching, the other almost looking past you, he says: 
> 'brigands, and butchers, murderers and marauders! What are you doing in my home? Answer swift, else I'll skin the lot of you!'

If a player makes any suggestion that they come in peace, read the following.
>[!recite|no-title]
> He lowers the knife and says: 'oh, well, why didn't you say so? Oh I haven't had guests in a bloody minute! I apologize for not tidying up!' He grabs one of the pots he'd left on the floor, and tosses it into the washbasin. 'You know, my grandpapi used to live here? He used to run the whole place! There was dozens of people here, he ran them all! Say-i've almost forgotten!' He hits his forehead with his palm. 'I've got tea! Would you like some?'

If they accept, read the following. 
>[!recite|no-title]
> He turns around and reaches down into a cupboard and pulls out a large burlap sac. 'it's a strange brew, i'll admit! But it gives a funny aftertaste. The scribes sure had a taste for the stuff though! I'll bet me ol' great-grandpapi did too!'
