> Your head begins to tingle, a strange stinging behind your eyes. Then your eyes begin to blur as you feel your spirit be pulled from your body. The mind and memories of your host begin to leave you as a wave of memories and knowledge of your spectral nature floods back in. You are pulled away from the material plane, violently forced through a mass of living, writhing roots. Through a field of clouds, again seeing the white city beyond the hill. Then back up to the sights of the vibrant green field again, and the inverted cliffs overhead, and once again you feel *the Presence* is with you once again...

This brings the session to a close.
