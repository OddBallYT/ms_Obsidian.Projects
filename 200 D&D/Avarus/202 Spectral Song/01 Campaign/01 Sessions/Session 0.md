### 1. Welcome & Introduction

- **Campaign Overview**
    - ***Vocabulary***
	    - **Campaign**: Long overarching story between every session
	    - **Session**: The game played in a single day
	    - **Adventure**: A single plot thread, usually played through a single session
	    - **Spectre**: A player's actual body in the campaign
	    - **Host**: The characters that the player's use to conduct adventures
    - ***Setting and tone***
	    - The tone will be slightly different for each adventure, spanning mystery light horror, comedy and others.
	    - **Brief history**
		    - A group of explorers sailed from the *old world* (now lost) to Avarus, settling originally the eastern coast (now known as the Estavar). After a few hundred years, and lots of development people expanded west settling the central area of the continent. After a war between the two primary factions, that resulted in the split of the north and the south, known as Nordavar and Sodavar. After many years of a stagnant cold war then regent of the Sodavar decided to start a push west to inhabit the Westavar, the last bit of uninhabited land on the continent. Nordavar followed suit, resulting in a standoff between the two major city-states that developed in the Westavar: Vershaw of the south, and Arkley of the north.
	    - Spectral Wardens
		    - You are a spectral warden, AKA a spectre. You were created by a mysterious force known to you only as *The Presence*. This *Presence* uses you as it's 'hands' used to intact its will. You have agency, but are subject to the will of the *Presence*. 
	    - Each adventure will be self contained, and vary in tone, theme and contents. 
    - House rules.
	    - Rerolls.
		    - There are destructive and non-destructive rolls.
			    - Destructive rolls change the world around them such that the roll can not be reattempted. For example if you try to jump and catch a ledge, and fail and fall, you can not retry as you've already passed the ledge. (Charisma checks, like trying to convince someone of something also falls in this category).
			    - Non-destructive rolls are rolls that can be reattempted, in a way that the world remains the same. For example, if you try and fail to climb a tree, the tree is still there and can be reclimbed. However on a fail there may be consequences, such as taking damage from falling down the tree.
	    - All players start at level 3.
	    - The party has a collective spectral level. This level grants abilities at new level, and applies to all players and usually provides opportunities for teamwork

    - Since players are not inherently their hosts, while the hosts are not being controlled by their spectres, they have agency. This means they can act on their own between sessions. For example if your host is a big spender, you might return to your character to see that gold is gone, and you now have some special or unique item. 
    - If anyone needs help building their character, let me know and I will help.
