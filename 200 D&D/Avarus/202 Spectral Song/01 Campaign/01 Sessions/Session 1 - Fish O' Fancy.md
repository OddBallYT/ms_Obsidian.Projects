### Adventure Summary
The [[Saulker]] festival is back! And Baron [[Renold Abbot]] has booked a celebrity fisher [[Fishmonger Morg]] appearance for the fish-off! Only problem is this [[Fishmonger Morg]] is a little *too* good, and it risks losing the investment of a [[Vershaw]] merchant, after being advised by baron [[Renold Abbot]] to bet on a local fisherman.

[[Fishmonger Morg]] also has an issue. He recently caught a baby [[Zephyrmaw Leviathan]] and plans to sell it off to a collector, but without him knowing, the mother has been tracking him all the way to [[Saulker]].
