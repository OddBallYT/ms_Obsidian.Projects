## Coin Pouch of Holding

_Wonderous Item, Very Rare (requires attunement)_

### Description

This magical satchel appears as a sturdy, deep-brown leather bag with a wide, reinforced opening. The surface is adorned with intricate **golden runes** depicting various animals, shifting subtly as if alive. The silver clasp is shaped like a beast’s maw, and the inside is a pitch black void. When opened, emitting a faint echo of distant nature sounds (a light breeze, rushing water...) as well as any animal that is held inside. Despite its size, the satchel remains **5 lbs**, regardless of its contents.

### Capturing Creatures
As an action, you can attempt to **store a large or smaller creature** by opening the bag and pointing it at your target within 10 feet. The creature must make a **DC 18 Strength saving throw** or be **pulled into the satchel**. Willing creatures can enter freely.

Creatures inside the satchel are **safely suspended in time**—they do not age, require sustenance, or suffer harm unless the bag is destroyed. They are aware of their surroundings but cannot act.

### Releasing Creatures
As a bonus action, you can call out a stored creature’s name into the open mouth of the bag, causing it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you.

### Extradimensional Habitat
The satchel contains a pocket dimension capable of holding up to **5 creatures** of Large size or smaller. Each creature resides in its own separate environment, which adapts to its natural habitat (e.g., water for aquatic creatures, dense jungle for a panther, underground burrow for a badger).

### Entering the Bag
A willing creature is able to enter the bag, and leave at will. It goes to the habitat of the creature it wants to go to. If it doesn't know what creatures are inside the bag, it goes to a random one. If there are no creatures inside the bag, they create an empty habitat that suits them.

### Limits
- The satchel **cannot hold sentient creatures (Intelligence 6 or higher)** unless they are willing.
- Attempting to store a creature larger than **Large size** causes the satchel to reject it, forcing the creature back out.
- If the satchel is overfilled, attempting to add another creature causes the oldest stored creature to be expelled.
- Destroying the satchel releases all stored creatures **within 30 feet of its destruction.**

### Caveats
Placing a bag of holding inside an extra-dimensional space created by a Handy Haversack, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.
