>>## History
>>***Foundation Date.*** 1200pd (currently 1280pd)
>>***Founders.*** Reyruun Abbot, Huron Canis, Mordyn Mauredar
>>***Founding Story.***
>>	Saulker was founded when the city of Vershaw started a development campaign, incentivizing settlers to travel to uninhabited places, and make them their own. In this endeavor, 3 families united in the founding of Saulker: the Abbots, the Canis’ and the Mauredars.
>>	The Abbots have come to be the trusted leaders of the village. While Saulker has democratic elections, many of the elected barons throughout the village’s lifetime have been an Abbot.
>>	The Canis family have been much less outspoken in the town’s leadership. They had taken to a darker side, establishing a new branch of the Watchers of the Moon thief’s guild, in the south. Though this information is not commonly known.
>>	The Mauredar family seemingly vanished nearly 50 years ago. Little more information is known to the common person. To those who know, the Mauredar family went east and north, establishing a keep there. Then began delving into the occult.
>>
>>***Notable Events.***
>>- The Saulken Seas Festival
>>	- Every four years the town holds a large festival to celebrate the town's bounty and history. It frequently draws in people from all over the realm
