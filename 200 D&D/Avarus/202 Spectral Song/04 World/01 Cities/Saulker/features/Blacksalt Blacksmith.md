### Opening Description
>[!recite|no-title]
>The walls are all covered in a thin layer of soot, and the whole building smells of charcoal. The room you enter seems to be a living room. A small covered pot with a crackling fire, and a bench with wool upholstery. The room stretches around to the right with what seems to be a stairwell going down.
