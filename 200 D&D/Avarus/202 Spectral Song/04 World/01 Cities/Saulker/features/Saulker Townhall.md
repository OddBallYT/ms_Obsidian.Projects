### Opening Description
>[!recite|no-title]
>The outer walls are solid stone, and all doors are reinforced with wrought iron. In another room, you can hear the slow and quiet clinking of metal. There's a staircase going up. To your left is a door, and to your right is a desk, where a woman sits, rummaging through papers.
