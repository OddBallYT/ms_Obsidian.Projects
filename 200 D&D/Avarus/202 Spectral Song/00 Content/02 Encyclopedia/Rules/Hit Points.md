Hit Points (HP) are a measure of how difficult it is to kill or destroy a creature or an object. Damage reduces Hit Points, and healing restores them. You can’t have more Hit Points than your Hit Point maximum, and you can’t have less than 0. _See also_ “[[Breaking Objects]]” and “[[Damage and Healing]]”.
