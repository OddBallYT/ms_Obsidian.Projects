D20 Tests encompass the three main d20 rolls of the game: [[ability checks]], [[attack rolls]], and [[saving throws]]. If something in the game affects D20 Tests, it affects all three of these rolls. The DM determines whether a D20 Test is warranted in a given circumstance. _See also_ “[[D20 Tests]]”.
