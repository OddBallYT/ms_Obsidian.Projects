>> ### Summary
>> Throne is a card game, which involves players taking a suit, and using the cards to either defend their king and queen, or attack another player's king and queen.
>> ### Players
>> Throne can be played with a minimum of two players, and a maximum of distinguishable suits available. This means that with one deck of cards, a game can have four players. But if there are two, visually distinguishable decks available, this means that eight people can play.
>> ### How to Play
>> The rules of Throne are quite simple, involving each player taking turns, to preform an offensive or defensive  action. Jokers are not needed, and can be removed from the deck, and set aside.
>> #### Starting the Game
>> To start, the deck(s) are divided into their suits, and each player receives a suit. Each player takes the king and queen of their suit, from their pile, and places them side-by-side, face up on the table in front of them. The remaining pile of cards is shuffled, then placed beside them, face down to their right. They then pick up three cards from the pile, to fill their hand. A first player is decided by whatever means the group choses, then play proceeds clockwise.
>> #### Taking an Action
>> Once play has started, on a players turn, they can choose to take an offensive action, or a defensive one, or can simply end their turn by forfeiting their action, and discarding a card. An action involves placing an action card (a number card, an ace, or a jack) on their own, or another player's keep.
>> ***Keep.*** A keep, is the four spots around a player's king and queen. Each player has eight of these spots. One of these spots in a keep, is called a *cell*
>> ***Offensive.*** An offensive action involves placing an action card in another keep. This is done to deal damage to a player's monarchs, or break down their defenses.
>> ***Defensive.*** A defensive action involves placing a card in your own keep. This is cone to build defenses.
>> #### Counting Damage
>> Each player's king, has a total of twenty hit points, and the queen has fifteen hit points. Damage on a card is counted by adding up opposing number cards then subtracting the total from the cards hit point maximum. If a number card is removed, the damage from the card it was attacking is also removed.  
>> If an offensive card is played on top of a defensive card, the total value of the defensive cards is subtracted from the total of the offensive cards.
>> If the value of an offensive card, is placed on a defensive card of the same value, both cards are removed an placed in the discard pile of their respective players.
>> #### Special Cards
>> There are two special cards in each players deck, the *ace* and the *jack*. These two cards have unique abilities.
>> ***Ace.*** The ace is placed on a cell of any player's keep. All of the cards in that cell are removed, and returned to the discard piles of the respective players.
>> ***Jack.*** The jack
