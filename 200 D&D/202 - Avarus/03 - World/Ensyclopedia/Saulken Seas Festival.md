Started seventy-four years ago, every two years, the town of [[Saulker]] hosts a massive festival, in calibration of their home, and the bounty it provides. The festival is in large part to draw tourism to the area, but also provides a fun time, and community for the locals. The festival is a greatly loved, and treasured time, with all the participants putting their best foot forward with stalls, music and shows.
