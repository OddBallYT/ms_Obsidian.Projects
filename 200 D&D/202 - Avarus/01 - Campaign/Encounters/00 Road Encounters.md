>> Whether or not the players encounter opposition while travelling the road is dependant on what road they're travelling, and for how long.
>>  ##### Road Types
>>  There are three different types of roads, each with their own unique set of dangers (or lack there of). These roads are: *protected*, *urban* and *back*.
>>  ***
>>  **Protected**
>>  Protected roads are roads that are near larger cities. They are as the name suggests: protected, and thus have very little risk. The can also be vital trade routes, even if not particularly close to cities.
>>  
>>  To determine of the party gets attacked on a **protected** road, roll 1d20 + (number of hours travelled / 2). If the roll is, or is higher than 18, the party gets attacked. If true, roll 1d4 and follow the chart below to determine enemy and count.

>> | 4 | Ogre | 1d2 |
>> ***
>>**Urban**
>>  Urban roads are roads that are commonly found between towns, or on the outer edges of cities. These are commonly used roads, but are not protected. This makes them especially dangerous as they are not patrolled, but are still used commonly enough, that bandits and kobolds frequently watch them for their next mark, as well as the frequent use attracting other beasts.

>> **Back**
>>  Back roads are roads that are not commonly used. They can be found between small towns and hamlets, especially on the edge of the realm. Some could more accurately be described as 'trails'. Still, they are relatively save to travel. Even though they are unprotected, they are used rarely enough, that bandits and kobolds generally don't bother watching them for travellers. 
>>  
>>  To determine of the party gets attacked on a **back** road, roll 1d20 + (number of hours travelled / 2). If the roll is, or is higher than 14, the party gets attacked. If true, roll 1d4 and follow the chart below to determine enemy and count.
