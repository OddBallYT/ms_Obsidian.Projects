A promise made in the north. When one person does something for another, something that the subject can not pay back, a hvatadrikvatan is made. This states that the subject will take care of the family of the person, in case of an event that causes the person to be unable to. 
>Most often, this pact is made in regard to a child, but it has also been known to regard to a wife, niece, nephew, parent or other close family member.
