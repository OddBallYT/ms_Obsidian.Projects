> The realm [[Eldewind]] encompasses [[The New Union]]. Due to this, the states of Eldewind have grown in relative isolation, often ignoring others outside their realm.

 A **realm** is a specific area of land defined by historical or political significance. The borders of a realm have no real significance, states frequently deal with others within their own realm, as well as ones outside, or in a different one.
>The borders of these realms often change and are not all-encompassing. Meaning there *are* large areas of land that **do not** belong to any specific realm. These areas are known as Dead Lands.

> Dead Lands are areas defined outside of any currently existing realm. These lands are not *functionally* dead, most still contain civilization, various states, towns, roads and trade routes, among other things.
