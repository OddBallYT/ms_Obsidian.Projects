In Ljakenvel, wood was hard to come by in Ljakenvel, as so was considered a valuable resource, and was coveted, reserved for important buildings, such as longhouses, and chapels. Wood was also often used as a material for cutlery and dishes for lords; petty kings and warlords, as a symbol of majesty. These utensils were often lavish, with waxed wood, and silver or gold filigree.
