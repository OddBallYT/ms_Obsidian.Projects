### Summary
Born to [[Geir]], wife of the [[Baldengard]] blacksmith [[Thed]]. Ylva was born with a strange skin pigment, causing the left half of her body to be pure white, while the right side is simple pale skin. Her hair is snow white, and her eyes are a pale whiteish-blue. She's small, and incapable of speech, but have grown to use gestures, and animalistic sounds as effective enough communication to convey basic sentiments.

Due to her disfigurement, she has been kept relatively unincorporated with the rest of [[Baldengard]], primarily by her mother [[Geir]]. Her father does not entirely support this confinement, but does not wish to go against his wife.

### Personality
Being unable to communicate verbally, Ylva has become wrapped up in her own head, and irreparably connected to those close to her, namely her oldest brother [[Randalf]]. She is violent in her love and protection of those she loves, and prone to violence when that safety is threatened.
