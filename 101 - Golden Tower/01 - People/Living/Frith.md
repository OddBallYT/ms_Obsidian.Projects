### Summary
Frith's father [[Fritr]], was a guard for [[Bjark|Bjark's]] home. When [[Balden]] was a baby, the slaves of [[Nuvanir]] revolted, trying to kill the leaders and take control for themselves. One of these slaves managed to sneak into [[Bjark|Bjark's]] home, to attempt to kill baby [[Balden]]. [[Fritr]] killed the man, and saved [[Balden|Balden's]] life. In return, [[Bjark]] named the first born of [[Fritr]], [[Hvatadrikvatan|hvataneratar]].  Almost 2 years later, Frith was born, her mother dying in child birth, and another year by, [[Fritr]] dying to an infection from an injury sustained in battle. Care of Frith was given to [[Bjark]], who raised her as his daughter, as he had promised.
