### Path
[[Higga Swiftfoot|Higga]], now invested in rooting out the city's doppelganger problem, says that there is an abandoned house to the north of the city, and that strange ongoings have been heard coming from there. She is unsure of whether or not it's connected, but she states that it's worth a look.

Upon arriving at the mansion, they see that is is large, and decrepit. Large holes dot the walls, and moss fills it's crevices.
