### The Heist
Read the following when a player approaches the manor.
> [!quote]
> The manor is massive; two floors, and a walkable roof. The front is fitted with a maze of perfectly trimmed hedges, surrounded by a large wrought-iron fence, topped with spikes. The walls of the manor are pristine light grey stone, not a single scratch can be seen on it's whole face. Further up, the building becomes a dark, polished wood. Plenty of windows cover the walls, but all of them are dark. A balcony is on the second floor, in the  front, and an aqueduct stretches into the second floor from the north.

#### Entrances
* The front door
	* Guarded 24/7
	* Need to get through the locked iron gate, and the front door
	* Need to make it passed the patrolling guard
* The Aqueduct
	* Small, hard to fit in
	* Leads down into a bathroom on the second floor
* Windows
	* Hard to sneak in without being seen
* Roof
	* Guarded 24/7
	* Need to get up without being seen
#### The Objective
The objective is to steal the manors jewel. While it's properties are unknown, it is reported by Simcoe to be magic of some sort, and highly protected and coveted by the lord and lady. No one is allowed to see it except them two.
When a player sees the gem, read this description:
> [!quote]
> The gem is white, with a pulsating blue glow in the middle. Though it's exact shape is difficult to pinpoint, is seems to swell and contract, while subtly varying its shape. You feel a strong power emanating from it, a sort of force that's almost pushing you away.

If the gem is destroyed, or brought at least 100 feet away from the manor, the manor degrades, aging hundreds of years in the span of seconds: the hedges overgrow, the wood rots, stones crumble. The same happens to it's lord and lady. Lady Abbott dissolves and crumbles into a pile of black sand, and the Lord Abbott ages, and mutates into a black, rotted and terrifying looking monster, that immediately attacks anyone nearby.
### Other Notes
* The lord and lady Abbot occasionally see aristocratic and wealthy guests.
* The Lord rarely leaves the house, and when he does, he remains within the manor's grounds. The Lady never leaves the house
