> The building is obviously abandoned, and ruined far past it's 2 years. There are large gaps in the walls of the upper floors, much of the wood still remaining is rotted and decaying. However, the bottom layers that are made of solid stone have fared much better. A wrought iron fence surrounds the whole area, and an overgrown cobblestone path leads up to the main door. The door is heavy reinforced wood, and to its left, are two small windows. To the right, is a continuation of the pathway that looks to lead to the back yard. 

Entering the mansion is the adventurers' first challenge. The door to A1 is heavy wood, locked, and expanded to make it nearly impossible to open, characters can attempt a strength DC 18 check to open.
The windows to the left are just big enough for a small character to fit through, with a successful Dexterity (Acrobatics) DC 14 check. The windows bring them to A3
Characters can also attempt to climb the building, and enter through one of the gaps in the upper floor, with a successful Dexterity (Acrobatics) DC 16 check. With this method, they enter into A12. 
Characters who go around back can make a Wisdom (Perception) DC 10 check to notice the mounds of re-buried dirt along the back fence, characters with a shovel can make a Strength (Athletics) DC 16 check to dig them up, if they do, they find various bodies, all torn up and maimed. An Intelligence (Medical) DC 12 check reveals the poison burns on the bodies. The back door is locked, but flimsy and can be broken open with a Strength DC 10 check, bringing the characters into A6.
