The <mark class='purple'>Abandoned Mansion</mark> is located in the north of Den. Formerly the residence of a diplomat from [[Opelia]], it has now been abandoned for 2 years and has fallen into disrepair.
### Location Overview
Located in north [[Den]], east of the castle, the <mark class='purple'>Abandoned Mansion</mark> was formerly the home of an Opal Emissary, and prolific merchant; a human man by the name of Trinen Kinsely. Though after he was attacked and killed on the Opal Road, his home in [[Den]] has gone uninhabited, and used by various vagabonds.
For a while, the house has been rumored to be haunted, or inhabited by occultists, monsters or whatever else the minds of the people can come up with.
### Quest Goals

> The building is obviously abandoned, and ruined far past it's 2 years. There are large gaps in the walls of the upper floors, much of the wood still remaining is rotted and decaying. However, the bottom layers that are made of solid stone have fared much better. A wrought iron fence surrounds the whole area, and an overgrown cobblestone path leads up to the main door. The door is heavy reinforced wood, and to its left, are two small windows. To the right, is a continuation of the pathway that looks to lead to the back yard. 

Entering the mansion is the adventurers' first challenge. The door to A1 is heavy wood, locked, and expanded to make it nearly impossible to open, characters can attempt a strength DC 18 check to open.
The windows to the left are just big enough for a small character to fit through, with a successful Dexterity (Acrobatics) DC 14 check. The windows bring them to A3
Characters can also attempt to climb the building, and enter through one of the gaps in the upper floor, with a successful Dexterity (Acrobatics) DC 16 check. With this method, they enter into A12. 
Characters who go around back can make a Wisdom (Perception) DC 10 check to notice the mounds of re-buried dirt along the back fence, characters with a shovel can make a Strength (Athletics) DC 16 check to dig them up, if they do, they find various bodies, all torn up and maimed. An Intelligence (Medical) DC 12 check reveals the poison burns on the bodies. The back door is locked, but flimsy and can be broken open with a Strength DC 10 check, bringing the characters into A6.

### Keyed Locations
***A1. Entrance Hall***
This is the primary entry hall for the mansion, A long hall, with a doorway on either side, and stairs going up on the right. Looking down the hall reveals a kitchen, and the backdoor. Another smaller door is at the back of the hall, to the left. The room is dark, the only light coming in from the large mudroom to the left, shining on the tattered and torn tapestries and stained weathered paintings that line the walls.
***A2. Living Area***
A large living area. This place is dark, but looks to be mostly intact, when compared to the rest of the house. Couches look to a fireplace placed at the back wall, and a large green rug in the middle of the floor.

If characters decide to investigate the fireplace, they can make an Intelligence (Investigation) DC 12 check to reveal the thinness of the back wall of the fire place, and the cracks that can be seen through. With a Strength DC 16 check, the wall can be broken, and with a Dexterity (Acrobatics) DC 10 check, the characters can descend to A16.
***A3. Mudroom***
The mudroom serves as the only natural light on the main floor. The two small windows cause this room to glow.

***A6. Kitchen***
A long kitchen. Dishes in the sink, and a cutting board, with a moldy slab of ham, a knife sitting above some cut slices. Cabinetry along the bottom and tops of the walls, all emptied. A door to the backyard, and a small pantry, sparce with moldy and rancid food.
***A7. Pantry***
A deep pantry, sparsely filled with moldy and rancid food. A shelf has fallen down, and pulled a board off the back wall. Its dark, but there may be something there.

***A15. Wine Cellar***
A room with 6 large casques of wine, a Wisdom (Perception) check DC 15 reveals a bag of holding tossed under one of them.
***A16. Dungeon***
When a player enters the area. Read the following:
> [!quote]
> A dungeon. Musty, and dark. 4 cells line the back wall, and puddles of a thick green liquid dot the floor. Judging by the smell, it's very potent poison. The room is otherwise empty, eerily so: there are no bodies or leftover belongings in the cells, and the walls are void of any lighting. But on the far wall, there is a large hole, seemingly leading down to some sort of ravine.

***A17. Ravine***
When a player enters the area. Read the following:
> [!quote]
> A narrow tunnel, leading down to a cliff, and a massive ravine, stretching 50ft high, and an unknowable depth into opaque darkness. But as you lead yourself down this narrow way, you notice a sound: a chorus of weeping, growing as you approach. Until you spot its source. A group of three strange human-like creatures, tainted with purple flesh, heads buried in their hands, weeping at the cliff's edge. They don't seem to take notice of you, but you do take notice of a large stone alter behind them, what you guess to be the source of their woes.

If the players approach, read the following:
> [!quote]
> As you near, the weeping seems to wane, quickly falling to dead silence. The once closest, slowly raises its head, to look at you. You see its eyes, glowing purple, its veins pulsating with that same shade. Its nails, long and sharp, almost claw-like, and its teeth are fangs. It twitches violently, and its eyes dart, before it shrieks, and begins to charge.

After the Plagued are defeated, the party can examine the alter. Read the following:
> [!quote]
> Now in peace, you can examine the alter. It seamless, cut from one massive stone. Wrought iron fittings along the corners, support a dark wood top. And a small silver stand, seemingly custom crafted for the glowing purple gem that sits atop it.

If a marked player decides to take it, read the following:
> [!quote]
> The gem is ice cold, painfully so, as it glows an even brighter purple, the mark you bear on your arm, seemingly responding to it in kind; with its own golden glow. So do the marks of you others, that are marked. Then you are thrust into a vision, of the Well, its iron constructs, and its voice, asking you to bring it this gem you have found. While you are unsure of the reason or purpose, the worry in the voice seems to tell you, that more is at stake then you know.
