****
A jagged gold hilt, with shining blue gems along the length. The blade is an untarnished silver, that seems to radiate light.

***Breath Stealer.*** While a creature is impaled with this blade, they are unable to make sound. 

***Returning.*** If thrown, you can use a bonus action to return the knife to your hand, as long as you are in 60ft of the dagger's current location.
