****
A sleek, long, and thin pearlescent blade, with a black marbled obsidian handguard. Runes are etched along the length of the blade, and a small blade on the pommel of the sword.

***Silent Strike.*** When you hit a creature with this weapon, the attack makes no sound, and the target takes an additional 1d4 psychic damage. This effect also silences the target until the start of your next turn, preventing them from casting spells that require a verbal component or calling for help.

***Walk Beyond Light.*** You can cast the _Invisibility_ spell on yourself once per long rest without expending a spell slot. While invisible using this ability, you hear indecipherable, and ceaseless whispers, which distracts you, giving you disadvantage on wisdom (perception) checks and saving throws against being frightened. The spell's duration is 1 minute. 

***Absorb.*** On killing an enemy with the Opalance, the enemy shudders for a moment, before collapsing, all of their gear and possessions falling to the ground. With each enemy killed, you put a charge into the Opalance, that can be used to cast ***Banishment***. Charges remain, until spent.

***Banishment.*** You can expend a charge, and attack a creature. If the creature is, or below 20 health, the creature phases in and out of visibility, before disappearing. You then temporarily increase your dexterity by 1. Bonuses stack, but are lost on long rest. 

##### DM Notes
Occasionally, when the player uses the ***Walk Beyond Light*** ability, an effect happens. The effects of Opalance, can be found in the [[The Chosen of Mask]] Campaign Thread.
