### Keyed Locations
The following locations are keyed to the map of The Shimmering Caverns.

###### A1. Mouth of the Cave 
***Description.*** The opening of the cave, leads down into the entryway. The group must solve a riddle to enter.

When the party enters the cave, read the following boxed text aloud: 
> [!recite|bg-green] ‎ 
> As you enter, a sudden flush of cold air overcomes you. The narrow walls of the tunnel, only wide enough for one, are alight with a cool rainbow of colours. But it takes you a few minutes down the tunnel to find their source; small pulsing crystals are scattered across the walls. Another few minutes, you come to a wall, flat, made of one carved piece of solid rock, with another rectangular piece indented. A phrase is etched in the middle of the indented stone: *'What falls, but does not break, and what breaks but does not fall?'*

**Features**
* Panel
	* ***Description.*** *This panel is a hidden door. That leads to A2* The panel is two feet wide and five feet tall, smooth stone with a border carved out. Etched in the center is a phrase. 
	* ***Checks.***
		* A **DC 12 intelligence (arcana)** check, reveals the stone has a magical effect on it preventing it from being moved or broken by physical means. 
		* A **DC 14 intelligence (history)** check and proficiency with masonry history checks, or possessing mason's tools, reveals the stone was carved with chisels, likely over 1200 years ago.
		* A **DC 10 intelligence (investigation)** check reveals two small unlit crystals on either side of the indented stone.
			* The left one lights up if someone says 'Night'
			* The right one lights up if someone says 'Day'
* Gemflies
	* ***Description.*** Small harmless insects that glow like fireflies, but make their homes underground, often burrowing inside gems.
	* ***Checks.***
		* A **DC 10 wisdom (perception)** check, reveals the flies
		* A **DC 10 intelligence (nature)** check, reveals the flies are unusually larger than most

*The riddle.*  'What falls, but does not break, and what breaks but does not fall?'
*The answer.* 'Night and day'
*The result.* When both crystals are lit, the door opens. Read the following:
> [!recite|bg-green] ‎ 
> The air begins to flush with warmth, and the crystals all begin to pulse together, alternating colours from purple, to blue, to green, yellow, red and purple again. Then resonant tone begins to whine, as the indented panel of stone retracts, and is pulled down, revealing a cavern inside.

###### A2. Atrium
***Description.*** The entry hall of the dungeon. A large round room, the walls are a stone brick that has begun to fall apart, as well as being scattered with the same crystals found in the cave. In the middle of the room is a pedestal with letters listed from a-g. Around the middle pedestal are four more pedestals with small pools of water as well as carvings of various images on their sides.

When the party enters, read the following boxed text aloud: 
> [!recite|bg-green] ‎
