>> Arcspire is balanced for characters of 4th level, though a party of 3rd level can survive, if played carefully.
>> ### Location Overview
>> Arcspire is a massive tower, reaching far into the sky, and roots deep into the earth. 16 miles south of [[Saulker]], it was built as an arcane research facility at the summit of [[Mount Arcmire]]. Originally inhabited by an organization of wizards, and arcane scholars called [[Arc Emergents]], but has since been abandoned. The exact reason for the abandonment is unknown, but accepted lore, is that an experiment had gone awry, decimating much of the facility, and eventually leading to the abandonment, and guessed demise of the [[Arc Emergents|Emergents]].
>> ### Goals
>> To complete the [[Arcspire Quest]], adventurers must explore, to determine whether this is the location of the [[Saulker]] attackers.

>> > ###### Arcspire Features
>> > In the absence of the [[Arc Emergents|Emergents]], the arcane magic of Arcspire has gone unchecked, developing, and evolving into unpredictable forms, as well as the creatures who were the subject of experimentation. The upper floors are less occupied, and less subject to the wild magic, but as one travels deeper, the magic, and beasts become more prominent.
>> > ***Arcane Force.*** Throughout the entire facility, small blue and purple lights dance about, with a general, and dense feel of the arcane throughout.
>> > ***Arrow Slits.*** When using an arrow slit for protection, a creature gains three-quarters cover (see the rulebook) against outside threats. A Medium character can't squeeze through an arrow slit, but a Small character can with a successful DC 10 dexterity (acrobatics) check. 
>> > ***Ceilings.*** Ceilings throughout are ten feet high and flat, unless the text says otherwise
>> > ***Chimneys.*** Fireplaces throughout Arcspire are built from the same glassy black stone, and filter out directly out the wall. Some of those chimneys can be used to gain access to the tower.
>> > ***Doors.*** Regular doors are made of thick dark brown wood, reinforced with rusted iron bands and fitted with iron hinges and handles.
>> > ***Light.*** The walls are lined with arcane braziers, that went dark long ago. Adventurers require darkvision or their own light source to see inside.

>> ### Travel to Arcspire
>> Arcspire is located at the summit of [[Mount Arcmire]], the only road to it leaves from [[Saulker]], and grows more ruined, and overgrown as it grows further from the town. From [[Saulker]], Arcspire is 16 miles south, reaching the eastern foot of [[Mount Arcmire]]. Despite the road being so perilous in terms of construction, it is quite safe otherwise. Bandits never travel here, as few people travel the road to rob; and many of the beasts in the area have traveled south to the [[Merewood Forest]], or east out of [[Avarus]]. The occasional boar, eagle, and other grasslands/mountain beast can be found, but often not without looking.
>> The road then turns west, up to the summit. The road up is treacherous, and fraught with shale slides, small collapsed watch towers, broken stairs, and the occasional mountain beast. The road up is only 2 miles up, however the difficulty of the road causes it to take double the time.
>> ### Arrival
>> When the party arrives at Arcspire, read the following boxed text aloud:
>> > [!recite|bg-green] ‎ 
>> > A tower, sitting atop the summit of [[Mount Arcmire]]. Glassy black stones bordered with white mortar. Surrounded by thick wisps of bluish cloud slowly spiraling around it. Twenty-five feet up, the tower broken open, the remnants scattered across the mountain top. Narrow arrow slits carved into the stone, the inside dark, revealing no signs of occupation.  
>>
>> Entering the tower is the groups first challenge. The large reinforced wood has swelled with age. A strength DC 20 check is needed to break it open.
