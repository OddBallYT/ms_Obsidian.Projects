>> The Shimmering Caverns is balanced for characters of 2nd-3rd level, though a party of 1st level can survive, if played carefully.
>> ### Location Overview
>> The Shimmering Caverns are a series of caverns, fitted with old ruins that are scattered with faintly glowing gems. The location was home to an ancient tribe of people devoted to Mystra the goddess of magic. Carvings on the walls of the caverns depict the history of the group when pieced together.
>> ### Goals
>> To complete the [[The Shimmering Caverns Quest]], adventurers must explore, to determine whether this is the location of the [[Saulker]] attackers.

>> ### Travel to The Shimmering Caverns
>> The Shimmering Caverns are located 3 miles north of Saulker, at the southern base of the Saulkridge Mountain range. The Sunken Road is used to reach the caverns, it is well kept and commonly used. Though this means that bandits occasionally watch this road for their next mark. Roll a 1d4, if the number is 1, then 1d4+1 bandits attack the group.
>> ### Arrival
>> When the party arrives at The Shimmering Caverns, read the following boxed text aloud:
>> > [!recite|bg-green] ‎ 
>> > You arrive at the mouth of a cave, loose ashy gray rock, and hanging threads of thick green moss. It's throat glows faintly with a kaleidoscope of magical hues.

### Keyed Locations
The following locations are keyed to the map of The Shimmering Caverns.

###### A1. Mouth of the Cave 
***Description.*** The opening of the cave, leads down into the entryway. The group must solve a riddle to enter.

When the party enters the cave, read the following boxed text aloud: 
> [!recite|bg-green] ‎ 
> As you enter, a sudden flush of cold air overcomes you. The narrow walls of the tunnel, only wide enough for one, are alight with a cool rainbow of colours. But it takes you a few minutes down the tunnel to find their source; small pulsing crystals are scattered across the walls. Another few minutes, you come to a wall, flat, made of one carved piece of solid rock, with another rectangular piece indented. A phrase is etched in the middle of the indented stone: *'What falls, but does not break, and what breaks but does not fall?'*

**Features**
* Panel
	* ***Description.*** The panel is two feet wide and five feet tall, smooth stone 
	* ***Checks.***
		* If a player succeeds a **DC 12 intelligence (arcana)** check, they realize the stone has a magical effect on it preventing it from being moved or broken by physical means. 
		* If a player succeeds a **DC 14 intelligence (history)** check and has proficiency with masonry history checks, or mason's tools, they discover the stone was carved with chisels, likely over 1200 years ago.
		* If a player succeeds a **DC 10 intelligence (investigation)** check, they notice two small unlit crystals on either side of the indented stone.
			* The left one lights up if someone says 'Night'
			* The right one lights up if someone says 'Day'

*The riddle.*  'What falls, but does not break, and what breaks but does not fall?'
*The answer.* 'Night and day'
*The result.* When both crystals are lit, the door opens. Read the following:
> [!recite|bg-green] ‎ 
> The air begins to flush with warmth, and the crystals all begin to pulse together, alternating colours from purple, to blue, to green, yellow, red and purple again. Then resonant tone begins to whine, as the indented panel of stone retracts, and is pulled down, revealing a cavern inside.
