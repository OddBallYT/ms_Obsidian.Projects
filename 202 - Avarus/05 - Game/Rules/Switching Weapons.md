>> Say a player is fighting a dragon, and mid-way through the fight, the dragon takes to the skies. But the player, wielding a shortsword, is now unable to hit the dragon. The player needs to switch to a bow in order to shoot it. Typically, this would require the player to take a full action in order to switch it. But in this system, the player is able to *equip* various weapons, and can access the *equipped* weapons with a *bonus action*.

>> **Equipping**
>> To equip a weapon, or tool, you first need a sheath, or holster, for that specific weapon. These can be bought or ordered custom from a smith, and sometimes found at a general store.

>> The price is half of the cost of the base weapon (example, holster for a +1 long bow, is half the cost of a regular long bow). To use the sheath or holster, you need to equip it, which takes 1 minute. The weapon can then be equipped by putting it in the holster.

>> **Switching Weapons**
>> If a player has a weapon holster *equipped*, with the weapon, the player can switch to and from that weapon using a bonus action.
>> 
>> A player can still switch to any item that they don't have *equipped*, however this takes the normal full action.
