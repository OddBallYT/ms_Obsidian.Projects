### Background
In recent days, strange beasts have begun to appear, attacking small villages in the south-east of Avarus. These attacks have been widely ignored, and chocked up to routine bandit/goblin attacks, and fancification. But the attacks have persisted, and have spread further north, worrying many, that it might reach more prominent bastions of civilization. While those who dwell in the path of wreckage are unsure of exactly where these creatures come from, or why they're attacking, they all agree that they must be stopped.
