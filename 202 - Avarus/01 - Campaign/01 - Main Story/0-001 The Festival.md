### Background
In recent days, strange beasts have begun to appear, attacking small villages in the south-east of Avarus. These attacks have been widely ignored, and chocked up to routine bandit/goblin attacks, and fancification. But the attacks have persisted, and have spread further north, worrying many, that it might reach more prominent bastions of civilization. While those who dwell in the path of wreckage are unsure of exactly where these creatures come from, or why they're attacking, they all agree that they must be stopped.

# The Saulken Seas Festival
> [!column] ‎ 
>> [!info|clean no-title] Column 1
>> Every four years, the town of [[Saulker]] hosts a massive festival, in calibration of their home, and the bounty it provides. The festival is in large part to draw tourism to the area, but also provides a fun time, and community for the locals. The festival is a greatly loved, and treasured time, with all the participants putting their best foot forward with stalls, music and shows.
>>
>> The session opens at 10am on October 1st, the first day of the festival. The previous evening was busy with preparation, but the morning has been full of excitement. Stalls have been set up, with games to play, goods to purchase and people to talk to. When ready to start the session read the following aloud:
>
>> [!note|clean no-title] Column 2
>> > [!recite|bg-green] ‎ 
>> > It's autumn. October the first. The leaves have turned warm hues, and the air is beginning to don it's cool bite. But for you, this is an exciting time, because it's time for the Saulken Seas festival; a biennial festival hosted by the small fishing town of Saulker, located at the southern edge of the realm of Westavar, of the continent of Avarus. The festival was started seventy-four years ago by Barron Reyl Abbot as a way to draw tourism and encourage local trade. Now, it's a feature. One that draws people from all over the realm. Here is where you find yourselves. The smells of fresh baked goods, and the salty sea air; the sounds of crowds playing games, cheering, and music; and the sights of home. 
>>
>> The players are now free to explore. They start in separate locations, unless they have reason to be together such as an entangled backstory. The festival is divided into three separate sections: the market, the coppermug and the courtyard (where the trawler houses' HQ can be found). The players can choose where they wish to start, otherwise just place them randomly.
### Sections
#### Market
***Summary.*** The market is located at the harbor. There is a road that runs the length on either side, with stalls and small building messily scattering the space.  
> [!recite|bg-green] ‎ 
> The market is bustling, you can hear the waves crashing on the harbor, and seagulls squawking from somewhere unseen. Stalls scattered about the space, people buying and selling fresh breads, fish, herbs, and various trinkets. At some stalls games are being played, one man doing magic, a woman shuffling cups, both drawn crowds.

#### [[The Coppermug]]
***Summary.*** The inn and tavern of [[Saulker]], a popular spot for travellers to stay while passing through.  

If the player enters [[The Coppermug]] for the first time during the festival, read the following:
> [!recite|bg-green] ‎ 
> Inside, is a quaint tavern. The building is filled with a warm orange glow, emanating from a hearth along the wall across from the door. The aroma of rich ales, salty fragrance of grilled fish, and the ever present musk of old wood. A large crowd of people fill the building, all drinking, singing along with the music and playing games. The floor is scattered by tables, some round, some squared, all fitted with various number of chairs. From the door, the room stretches around to the right. At the back, is the bar, where a young gnome woman works strenuously to serve all the patrons. To its right is a small raised stage, where a gnomish man energetically plays the lute, along with a small band of compatriots playing a variety of instruments. There are two games being played, to the right at a round table is a card game, to the left is a game of dice.

**Features**
* The standard tavern fare.
* A game of Spider Eyes is going on to the left
* A game of Throne is going on to the right.

#### Courtyard
***Summary.*** The courtyard is the area outside the [[Trawler Houses' HQ]], a short tower in the centre, and a couple of residences around.
> [!recite|bg-green] ‎ 
> This area is significantly nicer than the rest of town. It's one of the only areas with proper cobblestone roads. Close enough to the sea to hear it, and smell it, far enough to still get a nice, green yard. You notice the largest building, with a red tile roof, the headquarters of The Trawler Houses, a union of local leaders, especially in the area of fish. But there is something unique here, a large banner, held aloft between the short tower in the centre, and a post on the other side, written in large black letters on it: 'finish'. And by the tower, there is a group of people herding a group of giant hogs. You gather, a hog riding race is being prepared.

**Features**
* The only thing to participate in here, is the hog races, but this comes in steps.

1. The participants must chose their hogs.
	* A **DC 12 wisdom (animal handling)** check OR a **DC 12 wisdom (insight)** check gives the player an idea of what hogs are stronger than others, this grants them a +1 to checks during the race.
2. Players, participating or not can chose to place a bet.
	* If they win, they double their money.
	* If their rider comes in 2nd, they get their bet back. 
	* Otherwise they lose their money.
3. Once the race starts, the players make a series of checks against each other.
	* Either a **wisdom (animal handling)** or a **charisma (intimidation)** check to start.
	* With **charisma (intimidation)** checks, if they rolled <5 they get a -2, if they rolled >17 they get +2 
	* If they succeeded the check when picking their hog, they get a +1
	* If they are a small creature they get a +1
	* If they are a large creature they get a -1
4. After 4 rolls, the player with the most won rounds wins the race.
# The Saulken Seas Disaster
> [!column] ‎ 
>> [!info|clean no-title] Column 1
>> Once the players are done at the festival, or the time reaches 4pm, the people are gathered to the harbor by Baron Reymon Abbot to begin the fishing derby. As the players make their way there, they overhear a citizen saying: *'Wonder where Marnon is, he was supposed to be here hours ago. He's going to miss the derby.'* 
>>
>> When everyone has gathered at the harbor, read the following: 
>> > [!recite|bg-green] ‎ 
>> > Barron Abbot stands at the edge of the harbor, ready to speak. He's an older man, greying hair, and long bony features. The crowds quickly quiets as he raises his hand. *'Ladies and gentlemen!'* A whoosh of wind kicks up. *'It's my distinct honor to host this festival once more. After twenty years, I still can't say the hog races bore me.'* You hear what seems to be a tree come down in the distance, amidst the laughs of the crowd. *'But now it's time for my very favourite event, the fishing derby!'* A roar of cheer from the crowd.
>
>> [!note|clean no-title] Column 2
>> At this point, the players make a **DC 15 wisdom (perception)** check, if succeeded, they notice a scream masked by the sound of the cheering crowds. Then continue reading the following:
>> >[!recite|bg-green] ‎ 
>> > Barron Abbot raises his hand once more to silence the crowd. *'You keep what you catch, and our top three anglers today each get a very special prize...'* He trails off, looking to something off behind the crowd. *'What in the seven hells...'* you hear him mutter as you, and everyone around you turns to look. But before you're able to process what you're seeing, you're knocked down. A mass of what you can only guess must be over a hundred creatures pours over the crowd. There are screams, as carnage is unleashed, people running, banging on doors to let them in, before they're clawed away by these things. You manage to get back to your feet amidst the chaos, left only wondering what to do...
### Setup
The players start in the market, there are a few groups of people fighting groups of these creatures. The players can also go to the [[The Coppermug]], or the courtyard, where battles are also are ongoing. There are a variety of different areas a player can participate in. 

**Areas**
* [[Market]]
	1. [[Reymon Abbot|Barron Abbot]] stands at the edge of the harbor, surrounded by three guards desperately fighting off four *Needle Blights*
	2. [[Pennen]], the halfling trinket trader wielding a decorative knife fighting two *Vine Blights*
		* If the players help him, he gives them the knife he was using, and says. *'Thanks for your help, here, take this knife, not great for cutting but it's worth a good deal. Seeing the state...I have matters to attend to in the north. Perhaps we'll meet again.'* He waves his hand in front of him and disappears.
		* The knife is ornate, the hilt made of ivory, and has the emblem of a waterfall pouring into a pool of water. The blade is made of pure silver. (This is the symbol of Eldath, goddess of peace.)
	3. A group of people banging on the door of a house, surrounded by five *Twig Blights*
* [[The Coppermug]]
	1. In order to get in, the part must fight a group of four *Twig Blights*  who are crawling over each other, scratching at the door to get in.
	2. [[Tansy Coppermug]] using a stool to swing at a *Vine Blight* from over the counter.
	3. A group of drunk patrons scrambling up the stairs, being clawed at by three *Needle Blights*
* The Courtyard
	1. A man with a pitchfork defending a woman and a young boy, and girl from three *Twig Blights*
	2. A man, farmer trying to defend his hogs from two *Vine Blights*, aided by rambunctious hog, larger than the rest, he calls *Bunk*
		* If they help the farmer, he offers to send Bunk with them to help. He says, *'Thank you, say maybe ol' Bunk here can help you, he seems to be in a fighting spirit. And he's good with orders.'*
	3.  A man with a torch swinging at a *Vine Blight*
		* If the party doesn't help him, or helps the other two first, the man is killed and drops the torch on a bail of hay causing it, and the building they sit under to light on fire.
		* If they help him in time, the man is spared his life, but knocked down, still dropping the torch. But the players have the opportunity to make a single action, or roll a **DC 16 constitution** check to try and put it out with their hands. If they fail, the building goes up in flames and they take 1d4 fire damage.
