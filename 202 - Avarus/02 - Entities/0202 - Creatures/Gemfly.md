>> ### Gemfly
>> Small harmless insects that glow like fireflies, but make their homes underground, often burrowing inside gems. Often used for lanterns that don't burn out. 
>> ***Master Digger.*** Gemflies are able to burrow into hard surfaces, most often gems and other crystals, where they make their homes and lay their eggs.
