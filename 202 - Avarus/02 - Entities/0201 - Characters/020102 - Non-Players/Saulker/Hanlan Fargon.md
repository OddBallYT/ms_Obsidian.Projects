###### Backstory
Grew up on the streets of Vershaw, was orphaned shortly after birth and ran away from the orphanage at 9. Met a group of other runaways, that called themselves 'the vermins', and joined them. This group includes: [[Dazz|Dazz the male half-orc]], [[Tinker|Tinker the female tiefling]], [[Fo|Fo the male half-elf]], and [[Fi|Fi the female half-elf]] (twin of [[Fo]]). He grew up with them, in the forgotten sewer maintenance room they called home. Would often pull scams, but after stealing some instruments with plans to sell them off, they began to play, enjoyed it and found they were good. Soon after, they began busking and street preforming instead of scamming, and became pretty successful. Though they never quite manage to purge the street rat from themselves...
