>> Sometimes a player wishes to attempt something, and the roll of the dice does not go their way. In cases like these, the player might wonder whether or not they can re-attempt the ability check. That is what this chapter seeks to lay out: when a player can, and can't re-attempt ability checks.
>> 
>> Ability checks are divided into 2 different types: **destructive** and **non-destructive**. **Destructive** ability checks, are ability checks where after a failed attempt, the world, or a character is irreconcilably changed, in which case the ability check can not be re-attempted. Contrarily, **non-destructive** ability checks, are those where the player simply fails to do something, and while these types of ability checks often have consequences on a failed check, they can be retaken.
>> ****
>> **Destructive Ability Checks**
>> Say a player tries to persuade an NPC to give them a discount in their shop, or a player tries to save themselves from a fall, by grabbing onto a ledge. These are examples of **destructive** ability checks, because the checks themselves change the world around the players. And when one of these checks is failed, their chance has passed, and they can not retry.
>>
>>In the examples above: a player fails to persuade the shopkeeper, the shopkeeper refuses, and is then uninterested in continuing to hear the pleas of the player. In the next example, the player misses the ledge, and falls, unable to retry to catch the ledge.
>>
>>This includes ability checks that a player's character would not reasonably know that they failed. Such as a character failing to check for traps. In-game, a character checks for traps, and finds nothing, believing there are none,

>> and would not reasonable believe that they failed to find them.
>> ****
>> **Non-Destructive Ability Checks**
>>Now, say a player tries to climb shale rock, or a player tries to cut the head off a fallen enemy. These are **non-destructive** as the opportunity to try again is still there, however these ability checks, as well as most **non-destructive** ability checks, have consequences, but can be re-attempted.
>>
>> In the examples above: the player falls back down the shale, from half way, hurting the player on the way down, and on re-attempt, taking more time to get back up, and reach the top. Next, the player attempting to behead the fallen enemy might miss the neck, hitting the platting of the enemies armor, causing the player's axe to chip and become damaged, and on re-attempt taking more time for the player to cut it off on the next attempt.
>> ****
>> **Re-Attempts By Other Party Members**
>> Sometimes a party member may want to take a shot at something that another party member failed at. In these cases, all **non-destructive** ability checks can be attempted by a different party member. However, only *some* **destructive** ability checks can. Like, for example, if a player fails to bargain with an NPC, another party member may be able to attempt as well, depending on the disposition of that NPC toward the party. In the original bargaining attempt, the disposition may have been damaged, thus not allowing another party member to try, but otherwise, they may be able to.
>> 
>> For **destructive** ability checks, whether another party member can attempt or not, is entirely situational, and is decided by the DM when the specific instances arise.
