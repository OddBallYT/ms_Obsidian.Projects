>> In order for adventurers to survive the wilds, they must eat. Pe-purchased food items and rations can only go so far. When an adventurer runs out of rations, they must find their own. There are various ways of doing this, but they fall into 3 different categories: locating, harvesting, and refining/preparing.
>> ##### Locating
>> Different biomes have a different number of species. Some, such as arctic has very little fauna at all, and can be very difficult to find anything to hunt. Others, such as forests, are rich in both flora and fauna, and finding food can be quite easy.
>> 
>> If a player seeks to hunt, they must first pass a wisdom (survival) check with the DC of the current biome.

>> After determining whether the player successfully tracks a creature, the specific creature that is found must be determined by the DM, by rolling a d100 and following the tables below. If the creature you roll is not present in the biome you are currently in, choose the next creature down in d100 value, that is present in the current biome. If there are none below, select the one above.
