>> In order for adventurers to survive the wilds, they must eat. Pe-purchased food items and rations can only go so far. When an adventurer runs out of rations, they must find their own. There are various ways of doing this, but they fall into 3 different categories: locating, harvesting, and refining/preparing.
>> ##### Locating
>> Different biomes have a different number of species. Some, such as arctic has very little fauna at all, and can be very difficult to find anything to hunt. Others, such as forests, are rich in both flora and fauna, and finding food can be quite easy.
>> 
>> If a player seeks to hunt, they must first pass a wisdom (survival) check with the DC of the current biome.

>> After determining whether the player successfully tracks a creature, the specific creature that is found must be determined by the DM, by rolling a d100 and following the tables below. If the creature you roll is not present in the biome you are currently in, choose the next creature down in d100 value, that is present in the current biome. If there are none below, select the one above.

>> ##### The Kill
>>  After the player finds an animal, they must kill it in order to harvest it. The player can attack it like any other animal, but they risk it running away, especially if the creature is easily spooked.
>>  ****
>> **Head-On Assault**
>>  If the player decides to attack the animal with a mele attack, the battle instantly begins, the player forfeiting all bonuses granted by the *Hunter's Shot*.
>>  ****
>>  **Hunter's Shot**
>>  The player can also decide to take a ranged shot at the creature. The player must succeed a *dexterity (stealth)* check against the animals perception - 2. If the player succeeds, the player rolls to hit with advantage. On a hit, if the animal is small, or tiny, it immediately dies, regardless of damage. Otherwise, the player considers the hit a critical, and rolls typical critical damage, if it doesn't kill the creature, the fight begins. If the shot misses, the creature rolls a *wisdom (perception)* check, *DC 12*. If they succeed, the animal notices the missed shot, and the fight begins. Otherwise, the animal remains unaware, and the player can try again.
>>  ****
>>  **The Battle**
>>  The player must roll an initiative roll against the initiative of the animal. During the battle, the animal may attempt to run (as decided by the DM). If so, and the animal's initiative roll was higher, it will run away. If the creature is in a biome with lots of cover (Forest, Hill, Mountain, Swamp) the animal is immediately lost. Otherwise the player must make a perception check to maintain sight of the animal.

>>##### Harvesting
>> The usable parts of a creature are divided up into 4 different categories: **meat**, **guts**, **bones** and **hide**. Each have their own uses, and different ways of harvesting. Some creatures have parts additional to the 4, such as the plating on an *iron golem*, or the fungus of a *myconid*. In these cases, it is deferred to the DM as to how it should be treated. The following system is for a typical creature, changes may be necessary to adapt the system to specific needs.
>>
>> The amount of each part is divided by weight, unless there is a specific reason otherwise. Example: a *bone naga* has no guts, skin or hide. Therefore the entirety of it's weight is in bones.
>> ****
>> **Dissecting**
>> Dissecting a creature and harvesting its parts can be a good way to make a bit of money, or a way of feeding, or protecting yourself while out in the wilderness.
>> If a player wants to dissect a creature they have killed (or found), they first roll the respective ability check to the part they wish to harvest (with the exception of blood. More can be found on blood, in the **Bleeding** section). If a player wishes to harvest multiple parts at once, they must roll all the checks individually (even if the checks use the same ability).
>> 
>> On a success, the player gets the component equal to the percentage that the component makes up of the creature. 
>> On a fail, the player gets *1/2* the total, if the roll was within 5 of the DC, and *1/4* if it was more (unless it was a 1, then the player gets nothing). In the case of **guts**, the player punctures or ruins the organ, getting the amount they would get determined by their roll, but making it worthless by monetary value.
>> ****
>> **Hacking**
>> Sometimes a player just wants a quick, and dirty way of getting a certain part of a creature. They can decide to **Hack** at the creature, gaining advantage on the ability check. But the amount they get is divided by 2. 
>> In the case of **guts**, whether the ability check was a success or a fail, the organs are punctured, and ruined, making it worthless by monetary value.
>> ****
>> **Bleeding**
>> Bleeding a creature is the best way to obtain **blood**, that can be used for alchemy, some magics or just to sell. **Blood** makes up *1/4* the weight of the **meat** component, and half the **Guts** component, and is lost when *drying* or *smoking* them, as explained more in the **Preparing** section. 
>>
>>To bleed a creature, the player must roll an *Intelligence (nature)* check *DC 14*. If the player succeeds, the DM rolls a d100 to determine how much of the blood is retrieved, by percentage, of the total weight of **blood**, equal to *1/8* of the creature's total weight is retrieved (minimum of 25). 
>>If the player rolls a natural 20, they get advantage on the d100 check. If the player fails the check, the DM rolls a d100 / 2, to determine how much blood they retrieved (maximum 50). If they roll a natural 1, the d100 is rolled with disadvantage.
>>****
>>**Amputation**
>>If a player wants to remove a limb or other loose part of a creature (head, tentacles, etc.) The player must roll a *strength* check against the creature's AC. External armor can be removed, in which case the player would roll against the creature's default armor. If the creature has natural armor, it cannot be removed (by any means, including skinning).
>>On a success, the player receives the part of the creature they were trying to amputate.
>>On a fail, the player fails to break through the creature's body, and does not receive the part.
>> ****
>> **What to Roll**
>> Each part of a creature needs a different skill to harvest. The ability and DC respective to each part can be found below.
>> 
>> | Part | Ability | DC |
>> | :-- | :-- | --: |
>> | Blood | Wisdom (medicine) | 12 |
>> | Bone | Dexterity (sleight of hand) | 10 |
>> | Guts | Wisdom (medicine) | 15 |
>> | Hide | Wisdom (survival) | 12 |
>> | Meat | Wisdom (survival) | 10 |
>> ****
>> **Component Breakdown Quick-Ref**
>> 
>> | Component | Portion |
>> | :-- | --: |
>> | Blood | 1/8 : %12.5 |
>> | Bone | 1/4 : %25 |
>> | Guts | 3/16 : %18.75 |
>> | Hide | 1/4 : %25 |
>> | Meat | 3/16 : %18.75 |
>> **Note**: Before **bleeding**, **guts**, and **meat** are equal to 1/4 of the weight.
>> ##### Preparing
>> After gathering materials from a creature, a player needs to properly cook, preserve or use that materials before those materials rot, and become worthless. There are various methods of preparation, depending on the intended uses. Meat can be cooked, dried, smoked or salted; guts can be cooked, used for alchemy, or processed into animal feed, etc.
