****
A vial that slowly pulses with a pale blue light. It's cold to the touch. Typically, the bottle appears as a simple 4 oz vial, but when being filled, can grow to hold 2 gallons (256 oz). When the bottle grows, the weight of the bottle remains 1/4 lbs, but the liquid inside becomes 1/2 its regular weight.
In addition, the liquid inside is preserved, and will not go bad while it is in the bottle.
